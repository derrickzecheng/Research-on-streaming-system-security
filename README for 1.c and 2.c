In this step, I am generate the two key file, one is private.DER, the other is public.DER.
1.c is the one that generate two key files:


make file:
gcc 1.c -o 1 -lcrypto               /// Compile

./1                                 /// run



Using the same make file command to compile and run the 2.c part.
