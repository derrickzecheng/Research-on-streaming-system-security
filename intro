 +# the first two weeks are the process that me and my co-worker Nan Jiang, who is a EE master, he is now on CS doctor. 
 +  We make a local streaming server by cutting the big file, or streaming into small segment, and play it using very different kinds of basically app
 +  
 +  
 +  first, is a app called dashcast, the dashcast can generate the mp4, or live stream, like the webcam or the audio input to a little segment, 
 +  the format is m4s, and mpd, and mp4 format. 
 +  mpd represent the media presentation description.
 +  m4s represent the segment videos.
 +  
 +  and we using the things called the MP4client inside the GPAC folder, after that we found we can play it in the localhost, using the output into the 
 +  ip address, and we can put the file into the localhost , and using the other app called GPAC to open it.
 +  Then we find the delay is about 10s, so it is not a real time function.
 +  we need to find a realtime, app the very low delay to play a video.
 +  
 +  Things I want to remeber: you need to change the chown of the directory to make it easy to put file in.
